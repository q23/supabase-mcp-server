- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - Zero-Touch Deployment (P1)
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational + US1 JWT generator - Broken Config Detection (P1)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational - Self-Hosted Connection (P1)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational - Cross-Instance Migration (P2)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on Foundational - Production Backups (P2)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on Foundational + US1 Dokploy API - Monitoring (P2)
- **User Story 7 (Phase 9)**: Depends on US1, US4, US5 - Multi-Instance Orchestration (P3)
- **Additional Features (Phase 10)**: Depends on Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Requires US1 JWT generator - Uses same JWT library
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Requires US1 Dokploy API client - Extends monitoring
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Requires US1 (deployment), US4 (migrations), US5 (backups)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests written first (if applicable) and must FAIL before implementation
- Libraries/utilities before tools
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003, T004, T005, T007, T008, T010)
- All Foundational type definitions can run in parallel (T011-T014)
- Validation framework tasks can run in parallel (T015-T018)
- Error handling tasks can run in parallel (T019-T022)
- Utilities can run in parallel (T023-T025)
- Once Foundational completes:
  - User Stories 1 and 3 can start in parallel (independent)
  - User Story 4 and 5 can start in parallel after Foundational
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 User Stories Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (10 tasks)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (25 tasks) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Zero-Touch Deployment (35 tasks)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Broken Config Detection (11 tasks)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 - Self-Hosted Connection (18 tasks)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 stories independently
7. Deploy/demo MVP

**Total MVP Tasks: ~99 tasks**

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (35 tasks)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo zero-touch deployment
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo config repair
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo connection management
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo migrations
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo backups
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo monitoring
8. Add User Story 7 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Demo orchestration
9. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (35 tasks)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 + 2 (sequential, US2 depends on US1)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (independent)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 + 5 (can be parallel)
3. Then converge:
   - Developer A: User Story 6 (depends on US1)
   - Developer B: User Story 7 (depends on US1, US4, US5)
   - Developer C: Additional Features (independent)

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 195
**MVP Tasks (P1 only)**: 99 tasks (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2 + US3)

### Task Count by User Story

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 10 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 25 tasks
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 35 tasks - Zero-Touch Deployment
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: 11 tasks - Broken Config Detection
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: 18 tasks - Self-Hosted Connection
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: 21 tasks - Cross-Instance Migration
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: 17 tasks - Production Backups
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: 15 tasks - Real-Time Monitoring
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: 20 tasks - Multi-Instance Orchestration
- **Additional Features**: 7 tasks - Auth, Storage, Functions, Knowledge
- **Polish**: 18 tasks - Testing, Documentation, Security, Production

### Parallel Opportunities Identified

- **Setup**: 6 parallel tasks (T003, T004, T005, T007, T008, T010)
- **Foundational**: 20+ parallel tasks across types, validation, errors, utilities
- **User Story 1**: 15+ parallel tasks in API client, env processing, validation
- **Cross-User Story**: US1 + US3 can start together, US4 + US5 can start together

### Independent Test Criteria

- **US1**: Deploy Supabase to Dokploy, verify auth works
- **US2**: Connect to broken deployment, detect issues, fix, verify
- **US3**: Monitor connections, access auth schema, run migrations
- **US4**: Migrate schema+data between instances, verify 100% integrity
- **US5**: Backup‚Üírestore round-trip, verify 100% integrity
- **US6**: Simulate pool exhaustion, verify alert triggers
- **US7**: Deploy dev, promote to staging, verify isolation

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Phases 1-5 (P1 User Stories)**:
- Setup + Foundational infrastructure
- Zero-touch Dokploy deployment (US1)
- Broken config detection and repair (US2)
- Self-hosted connection management (US3)

This provides immediate value solving the top 3 documented pain points:
1. Broken JWT generators (US1 + US2)
2. HTTP‚ÜíHTTPS conversion (US1)
3. Connection pool exhaustion and auth schema access (US3)

**Estimated Timeline**: 4-5 weeks for MVP (99 tasks)

## Notes

- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`
- [P] tasks can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Tests achieve 85%+ coverage per spec requirements
- Foundational phase MUST complete before any user story work begins
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
