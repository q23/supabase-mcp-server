- Include exact file paths

---

## Phase 1: Setup

- [X] T009 [US1] Add EXPOSE directives in Dockerfile (3000 for UI, 3001 for API)
- [X] T010 [US1] Add volume mount points in Dockerfile (/home/dokploy)
- [X] T011 [US1] Configure Dokploy startup command in Dockerfile (CMD)

### Docker Run Configuration

- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Create docker/dokploy/run.sh helper script (docker run with all correct flags)
- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Document Docker socket mounting in run.sh (-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock)
- [X] T014 [P] [US1] Document volume mounts in run.sh (-v dokploy-data:/home/dokploy)
- [X] T015 [P] [US1] Document port mappings in run.sh (-p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001)

### Validation

- [X] T016 [US1] Create docker/dokploy/test.sh script (test Dokploy UI accessible, API responding)
- [X] T017 [US1] Build Docker image and verify Dokploy installs successfully
- [X] T018 [US1] Start container and verify UI accessible at localhost:3000

**Checkpoint**: Dokploy running in Docker, UI accessible, ready for user creation

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Automated Dokploy Setup (P1)

**Goal**: Fully automated Dokploy installation, no manual steps

**Independent Test**: docker run â†’ wait 5 minutes â†’ Dokploy UI ready

### Automated Setup Script

- [X] T019 [US2] Create docker/dokploy/setup.sh automated installation script
- [X] T020 [US2] Add Docker + Docker Compose installation to setup.sh
- [X] T021 [US2] Add Dokploy installation to setup.sh (run official script)
- [X] T022 [US2] Add health check wait logic to setup.sh (wait for Dokploy ready)
- [X] T023 [US2] Add setup completion marker in setup.sh (/tmp/dokploy-ready)

### Dockerfile Integration

- [X] T024 [US2] Integrate setup.sh into Dockerfile (COPY and RUN)
- [X] T025 [US2] Add healthcheck to Dockerfile (check if Dokploy UI responding)

**Checkpoint**: Container starts â†’ Dokploy auto-installs â†’ UI ready within 5 minutes

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Docker Compose Integration (P2)

**Goal**: Add Dokploy to docker-compose.yml, works with other services

**Independent Test**: docker-compose up â†’ all services start â†’ Dokploy + Supabase coexist

### Docker Compose Configuration

- [X] T026 [US3] Add dokploy service to docker-compose.yml
- [X] T027 [US3] Configure dokploy service build context in docker-compose.yml
- [X] T028 [US3] Add Docker socket volume mount in docker-compose.yml
- [X] T029 [US3] Add dokploy-data volume in docker-compose.yml
- [X] T030 [US3] Configure port mappings (3000, 3001) in docker-compose.yml
- [X] T031 [US3] Add healthcheck for dokploy service in docker-compose.yml
- [X] T032 [US3] Update shared network configuration in docker-compose.yml

**Checkpoint**: docker-compose up starts Dokploy + all test services

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Documentation

**Purpose**: Complete documentation and validation

### Documentation

- [X] T033 [P] Complete docs/DOKPLOY-TESTING.md with all 32 tool testing examples
- [X] T034 [P] Add troubleshooting section to DOKPLOY-TESTING.md
- [X] T035 [P] Update README.md with Dokploy testing section
- [X] T036 [P] Document security implications of Docker socket mounting

### Validation

- [X] T037 Test deploying Supabase via MCP dokploy_setup_wizard tool
- [X] T038 Test dokploy_validate_config detects real Dokploy template bugs
- [X] T039 Test dokploy_regenerate_keys fixes real broken deployments
- [X] T040 Test all database tools (connect, execute_sql, inspect_schema) against deployed instance
- [X] T041 Validate environment can be recreated from scratch in <10 minutes
- [X] T042 Document any discovered issues or improvements needed

- Setup â†’ Foundational â†’ US1 â†’ US2 â†’ US3 â†’ Polish

**User Story Dependencies**:
- US1 (P1): Independent - base container
- US2 (P1): Depends on US1 Dockerfile - adds automation
- US3 (P2): Depends on US1 + US2 - adds Compose integration

**Parallel Opportunities**:
